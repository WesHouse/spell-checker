I spent almost 3 years at Oxford trying to understand what was wrong with me. And it was something wrong, I knew it was, with the kind of cold certainty that only appears in the mind after half a lifetime of subtle slips of the tongue.
?Sigmund," my secretary called from outside my office. ?There's a Mr. Rolf-Dieter on the line for you." She walked into the office, holding the office handset and looking at me with the standard office expression of polite attentiveness. No one else could have seen the undercurrent of distaste on her face. No one else could have known why it was there.
It was because I disturbed people.
?Thank you, Peggy," I said wearily. ?Give him my regards and ask him to make an appointment, please. I am otherwise engaged." I always encouraged my assistants to stay on a first name basis, hoping it would help. It hadn't, yet, but there wasn't really any point in stopping now.
Peggy nodded and closed the door behind her as she left. I turned my heavy head back to the paperwork below me. More signatures. More demands from the Senate for my research.
Did you know that our personalities are, for the first decade of our lives, like sponges? It's an odd analogy, I know, but nevertheless true. We absorb our surroundings, the words we hear, the smiles we see, and in our heads they are sucked in and blended with time until they form the brick and mortar of who we are. Oh, there's certainly a genetic influence, but it's more of a guiding hand than a solid base.
The issue arose when those experiences didn't mix, didn't blend. When they were stamped indelibly onto our memory with the firm hand of a spiteful, psychological God. I never truly assimilated those early defining experiences into my personality, because I remember everything, always and for all time. Oh, sure, I can fake it as well as anything can be faked. I've had plenty of practice. But I always remember the source of whatever it is that I'm copying myself off of, and that means that it's never quite me, whatever that should be.
People can tell. It's uncanny, they say. I feel like you're lying to me, they say.
You don't really love me, you said. And you meant it, and maybe it was true.
The curse had its benefits, of course. It took me 4 days to learn enough to pass the BAR exam. It took me 2 months to make my first million when I began manipulating the stock market, another 4 months after that to join Congress when I began manipulating the people, and once you're that far up the social ladder everything only gets easier from there.
I'm world famous, now. I've even got a catchphrase: ?Stay thirsty, my friends."
Stay thirsty for knowledge, because it is all that will stay with us. Stay thirsty in the hope that one day I will learn how to live and you will learn how to love me the way I desperately want to be loved.
I have been a lawyer, a surgeon, a senator, an author, a linguist, a researcher, a philanthropist. I have saved a thousand lives, kissed the cold glass of a thousand tumblers of Dos Equis, and worn a thousand faces.
I am the most interesting man in the world, and I do not know who I am.
